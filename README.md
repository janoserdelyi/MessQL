MSSQL CLI client in the spirit of PostgreSQL's psql CLI client

This code is a mess, apologies. PR's are welcome!
I'm in the middle of a job change and I love PostgreSQL and `psql`. The new job is very MSSQL-heavy and I haven't used MSSQL in about 10 years. 
Back then their CLI was atrocious, surely it's decent now, right? Right?
The official MSSQL CLI is really an embarassment. Microsoft should be ashamed.

So I decided to take a stab at the main features I use from `psql`

More notes on functionality and config to come.
